*Please uncomment code in Line 4 of erringComp.js in 'comps' folder to test error boundary. Also GitHub prevents me from pushing my code with my latest GitHub API access token. Please check my hosting link to test my project if possible, though I'm not sure it will be possible seeing as I'm running into issues with my hosting providers due to the GitHub API access token issue. Please pardon me. If there's a way I can send you the current access token to test my code with, please contact me with my email or any other form because even pasting here still won't work. Thanks*
